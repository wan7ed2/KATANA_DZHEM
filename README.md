FOR THOSE WHO READ READMES



\[Lyrics of the song "Gremlin's Song"]



\[Intro]

A year ago, I was sitting on a bench in a public park

On the corner of Beckton and Barking

I was thinking how to get out of England as a pawn in queens

To the top of the hierarchy, I've made all this up for myself



\[Verse]

A year ago, I was sitting on a bench in a public park

On the corner of Beckton and Barking

I was thinking how to get out of England as a pawn in queens (E)

To the top of the hierarchy, I've made it all up for myself

Now hipsters and art-bohemians are listening to me.

"After all, he's from London, where the exhibitions are — Portobello"

Not understanding what was hurting inside the line

Not understanding what's inside tarring Carthage

Ass-licking, enemies-journalists

The first compromises, monopolistic labels

I'm superfluous, like newbies at a bacchanal.

All the taller ones have starched collars.

It was homemade, self-made, someone didn't want to, he fell away

We're going to the hotel, you're going to the basement

But here the thistle, if it didn't have time, then it died.

Where you see success, I

feel like an old man.

At least I wake up with a boner

The grace of a hundred icons will not save you from consciousness

Complexes eat from the inside, I call it "complex nutrition"

From East London Concrete to Billboard Cover

In the club on Malaya Bronnaya I'm throwing up under Ivan Dorn

I hang out with the beau monde, I fall asleep in the restrooms

Under chlorophyll, but more often under chloroform, yau

For dessert, vomit with Heineken

God, how I Love Myself — Otto Weininger

My life is the adventures of Dunno

Inside Out like a whore in American Psycho

Aesthetes invented terms

Not knowing that they were walking Cerberus

"Finally, Russian rap has been recognized!" — don't I give a fuck?

The subculture is growing — a tumor, and

The subway doesn't accept it, and never mind

The bandstand resembles a ball of snakes

As a result, I'm Snape. Everyone plays roles — Cosplay

My track is no longer slalom, but bobsleigh

I go over the allegories in vain

Meanwhile, my love is fucking with someone in Montenegro

I need a doctor, preferably at home, and immediately.

House, Dre, Zhivago, Mengele

I'll give my skin to whoever likes it.

The goals I've reached are not encouraging

From E16, where they sell poison on the corner

Talker on the left shoulder, Gamayun on the right

The big uncles are already calling for the Afisha Picnic

Vladi reads there after me, and we'll record the fit.

And everything is wonderful, but

Kill me before I totally screw up.

I always start out cocky.

But I score a dick and drown at the very shore

They crave a fitting

And I'm still deciding who I am: underground or a corrupt bastard, yow

Virgo did not give in the ass, she said: "The principle"

But it killed the prince in me, like Gavrilo Princip.

The universe is napping

But it seems like rain is going to fall, very nice, Gremlin
